### 📘  *Assignment:  Display HTML to Verify Vercel Connection*
For this version of Day 1 project: Instead of submitting your 1-liner, I 
- took my Syllabus for Week 3 of Unsupervised and Machine Learning Master's course;
- converted it and some notes to a one-page Markdown document;
- fed the Markdown to week3.py to display as HTML.  

It wasn't as easy as it looks; but it wasn't so bad either.
