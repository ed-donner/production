# Week 1 – Medical Records App Modification

## Overview

I've created a modification of the webapp that implements a medical records management system. The application features:

- **Dummy Database**: Generated medical records using LLMs with structured outputs
- **Patient Selection**: Doctors can select patients from the database (static)
- **Reason Input**: Doctors can indicate the reason for checking the patient
- **Smart Filtering**: The app identifies which records are relevant based on the reason
- **AI Summary**: Provides a summary of the relevant medical records

## Repository

The complete application is available at:
https://github.com/javieroteromarquez/saas-medical-records

See the README.md in the repository for detailed information about implementation, setup, and usage.
